<h1>Make copies of repositories</h1>

You can copy a whole repository and then save it locally to your device without a connection to the internet.

<div>
TAKE A COPY OF THE REPOSITORY:
</div>

- Open the terminal (MAC)

- type `git` to check whether its installed onto your device.
You can download a repository by either an https or ssh format

- type `git clone` and paste the link of the repository you want
- a successful transfer will allow you to see the repository in your device and usually lands in your home directory by default.

`mkdir` - to make a folder. <br>
`cd` - change directory
use this then paste the repo into git clone to insert it in that directory. <br>
`pwd` - Shows you the current path/directory you've taken in your local device. <br>


<b> MAKE SURE YOU DONT HAVE SPACE IN YOUR FILE NAMES IT WILL CONFUSE THE TERMINAL</b>
