# Test Driven Development
Why is testing important?
<br><br>

It helps us check our code for bugs. Refine it where necessary and test the limitts of the code to see how powerful it is.
<br><br>

The 'agile' Methodolgy is a frame of mind for projects and employees to approach the tasks at hand.
<br><br>

Extreme programming: iterative coding and testing for a prject TDD takes these principles further when  evaluating code and implementing an iterative design process.
<br><br>

Refactor - changing how something works without changing what it does. Like optimisation for apps.
<br><br>

By running the parameters of the test we determine what the program is going to do
<br><br>

All testing classes are void by design

Red State: The test has failed or cant run.
<br><br>
Green State: We've written enough code to make the test pass. The test has passed.
<br><br>
Refactor:

The test class can auomatically generates the class method and datatype that you need based on teh test method you have written.
<br><br>

We do this for each test we would want to run on an application for testing.
