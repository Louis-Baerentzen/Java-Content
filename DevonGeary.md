# Devon Geary on creativity during Covid 19<br>
As things come back to normal how do we plan the easing for ourselves and adjust back to normal life?

<b>A background in Trauma-Theory</b>

A lot of the things you would have and do to provide for a family and yourself has been changed and disrupted fundamentally.
<br>

### <i>"Were not in the same boat, more like the same storm in our own boats."</i>
<br>
We all have a unique take on handling our lives and especially during this pandemic. We have the opportunity to open ourselves to perspectives and questions that we wouldn't usually have.
<br><br>
Isolation is tough - lots people have been isolated for months as of the end of May.
Devon has been actively distributing resources and technology to children who are particularly isolated.
<br><br>
How can we build trust among the software in the applications we create?
<br>

### <i>'Creativity needs honesty openness and empathy when creating a service that other people will use.'</i>
<br>
Collaborative efforts are going to shape the efforts of major businesses and prooducts.
<br><br>

##### The future of work and the language of 'the new normal'?

People who go through ptsd experience the before and after that marks their trauma. Prolonged experiences like this Covid pandemic.
<br>
Technology allows us to be able to provide a more collective and remote network and ability to maintain our normal routine.
<br><br>
The lack of normalcy can cause panic and this results to trauma.

This situation is a unique one in recent history and technology industry has a unique privilege in its applications.
<br><br>
The rhetoric used in things such as the medias coverage exacerbate fears. Panic buying is a good example of the implications fear can have.
<br><br>
Hope is a key player in coping with the trauma of this pandemic. Knowing that things are moving forwards and carrying gives people the hope that the pandemic becomes a smaller part of our lives.
<br><br>

##### Do we need to question more versus always finding an answer?

Answers can be dangerous, but they are needed in order for people to find closure.
We always need to have the ability to adapt.
<br><br>
Put yourself in situations that allow you to stretch your ability to empathise. Small gestures can be a good motivator and engine towards being mindful and technology allows us to maintain those social bonds and connections.
<br><br>

##### The difference between screen and person-to-person?
We miss the tactility of touch holding someone: the distance is a physical feeling that we all feel emotionally.
<br><br>
Even if you're comfortable with working from home or living on your own. The pandemic has stretched those norms to their limit concerning social interaction and the community atmosphere in a workplace.
<br>

### <i>Ask yourself: What would allow you to overcome the sensory deprivation during lockdown?</i>
<br>
See this as an opportunity to brainstorm ideas in ways people can tackle the distance

ie. have calls, brainstorm ideas to find what sensations they need?

Be aware of what challenges people face in this remote environment?

##### We often get hung up on designing a new way of doing simple things:
REMEMBER THE NEED NOT THE NOVEL!!!
<br><br>
Technology needs to be a holistic experience
