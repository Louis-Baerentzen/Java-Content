# Gary Sutherland

35 years technical experience in technology and testing. Longest experience gained through a company called `Expleo Group`. He has worked throughout many areas of hte tech industry.

Culture in a company and a country always varies between eachther
<br><br>
Countries have differnet values and differnt ways of organising their businesses and consequentially difernt laws and regulations enforced.
<br><br>
Language barriers are an issue when it comes to international business and trade. You need to be mindful of little differences.

### What is the life of a consultant

###### Hvae you seen the technology sector adapt to be more inclusive towards female employees

Over the last decade in particular the roles in tech for women has changed and become more involved.
<br><br>
There are projects that are nowadays being led by women there are more roles ran by women where they are in  head role in the organisation.
<br><br>
You need to be able to deelop your niche and then braoden your hirixons form that niche.

### What skills are needed for testers?

They dont have that tmuch importance early on in a career. The detail behind it isnt releveant until youre more experienced in that role and growing confindence in being independent.

### How do you keep up with the technology requirements?

Tools come and go, you also see tools being developed more extensively and being tiereated upon. They used to be just free tools (JIRA) but now are paid. You need to keep up to date with whats being exercised and used in the industry.
<br><br>
Remember that computer is always able to be broken down to component 1's and 0's you need to have an idea of what tools are best for an application.

### Other than tech what is important to have?

Communication skills are very important to have to keep a strong workflow in a project. The testing perspective is seen as an insurance policy towrds the development llifecycle. Technology hasnt necessarily changed over the years but the communication is very important stakeholder communication.

### Favourite project?
An insuarnce company in switzerland. Working abroad was an engaging experience and he awas able to build rapports easily abroad.

### Day-To-Day
He used to do programming and the work is very much tha same as a developer you understand what your projects are and what tests need to be undertaken as a result.

You need ot make it modular as possible so you can iteratea intop of it and extend the usability of your code.

###### My question: How did you gain your confiednce in new prgramming languages during your career whilst keeping them relevant during the rapid growth technology and its use in business has had?

Fundamentally the baics are still around, the only changes are the programming.

Rarely do you see code developed become redundant even with new languages coming in to the frame.

### What is the best testing strategy

Know your customers risk:
- What are They
- How do you prevent them
- How do you confront them if they materialise.
- Can you predict risk in the future
- Research risk from competitors and the current world.

Understand the business that your working for. The growth of the internet has been a breeding ground for risk in business so testing strategy is still the same: to mitigate risk but it is very much tailored to what that business may face.

What is an organisations appetite for risk
- what can they accept as risk

Banks are a very regulated and refined method and are very risk aware. Where as retail is a very flexible industry and risks change massively from day to day.

### Are there trends in this industry?

Do it early!! From thte start of the project dont wait for a finished piece of software before testing it it is iterative just like the development lifecycle.

<i>State that it 'WILL' not that it 'SHOULD'</i>

Is this requirement ambiguous or not when it comes to creating what is needed?

Wherever you are in the cycle everything is broken down understood by everyone all at the same time.

### What is the next big tool?
Anything testing wise will be of a direct result from the development field.

The security sector is definitely growing a lot more in the testing field and ismore of an issue thanks to the recent coronavirus.

Closed zoom calls that arent closed properly are hackable by the backdoor.

### Is there anything that surprised you during the career youve had

There is a level of expectation put on you more so than most of the employees.

Be the smartest when youre there on day 1 then dress one step more than how everyone else is dressed in the office.

Youre expected to be an echelon higher than the usual employees give 110%.

### What are the most common mistakes you come across

Be modular with your code kep it solid remember the principles of OOP.

Dont embed data into a test hard coding  datat in a test makes it not flexible. You are testing their code so know that code well and youll be able to write the right tests.
